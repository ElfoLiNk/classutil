* Added new `MapToObject` module, which takes a Scala map of type
  `Map[String, Any]` and converts it to a Java Bean. By default, it also
  recursively converts any nested maps of type `Map[String, Any]` that it
  finds. The transformation results in an object that can only really be used
  via reflection; however, that fits fine with some APIs that want to receive
  Java Beans as parameters.
* Updated to version 0.7.1 of [Grizzled Scala][].
* Updated to version 0.2.2 of [Grizzled-SLF4J][].
* Removed unnecessary dependency on old version of [Grizzled Scala][] in
  build file.
* Now compiles under Scala 2.8.0.RC5. Dropped support for prior versions.
