* Added new `MapToBean` module, which takes a Scala map of type
  `Map[String, Any]` and converts it, on the fly, to a Java Bean. By
  default, it also recursively converts any nested maps of type
  `Map[String, Any]` that it finds. The transformation results in an object
  that can only really be used via reflection; however, that fits fine with
  some APIs that want to receive Java Beans as parameters. For a complete
  description, see
  [the appropriate section on the web site](http://bmc.github.com/classutil/#generating_java_beans_from_scala_maps).
* Updated to version 0.7.1 of [Grizzled Scala][].
* Updated to version 0.2.2 of [Grizzled SLF4J][].
* Removed unnecessary dependency on old version of [Grizzled Scala][] in
  build file.
* 
* Now compiles under Scala 2.8.0.RC5. Now builds against RC3 and RC5 only.
