* Converted to build against Scala 2.10.0-M7. (Builds for Scala 2.9.x and
  earlier are maintained through the 0.x.x releases.)
* Converted to use the Scala 2.10 reflection API.
* Fixed Scala 2.10 feature warnings (`-feature`).
* Updated to use Scala 2.10 versions of [Grizzled Scala][] 
  and [Grizzled SLF4J][].
* The project now explicitly specifies the SBT [ls][] plugin, instead of
  assuming that it's globally specified, to permit others to build the
  project more easily.
