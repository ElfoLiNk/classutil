Fixes and enhancements from [Jon Crussell](http://github.com/jcrussell):

* Added a new (private) `BaseInfo` trait as a super trait for `MethodInfo`,
  `FieldInfo` and `ClassInfo`, allowing the various modifier convenience
  methods to be shared among the three public traits.
* Added descriptors and final values to `FieldInfo`.
* Removed spurious `hashCode()` and `toString()` methods from `FieldInfoImpl`.
* Added a `Synthetic` modifier.
* Fixed a "missing method" bug caused by hash code collisions.
