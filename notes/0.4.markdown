* Added the following methods to the `ClassFinder` object:
  - `classSignature`: Generates the runtime signature for a class name.
    e.g.: "Array[String]" -> "Ljava/lang/String;"
  - `methodSignature`: Generates the runtime signature for a method. e.g.:
    "def foo(s: String): Unit" -> "(Ljava/lang/String;)V"
* `ScalaObjectToBean` now creates setter methods, as well as getter methods
  (i.e., it produces true beans). See the documentation for `ScalaObjectToBean`
  for details.
* The [ASM][]-specific `InterfaceMaker` class now supports creating methods
  with parameter types. (Previously, it just created getters.)
* Upgraded to [ASM][] version 3.3.
* The generated [POM][] now uses a "scope" of "provided" for the ASM libraries.
  (The [Grizzled Scala][] and [Grizzled SLF4J][] libraries are still marked
  with scope "compile", however.)
