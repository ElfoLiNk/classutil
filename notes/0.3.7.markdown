* Merged changes from Alex Cruise to close input streams in `ClassFinder`.
  Streams were (inadvertently) left open and, therefore, cluttering up memory
  until the garbage collector ran.
* Now builds against Scala 2.9.0.1, as well as Scala 2.9.0, 2.8.1 and 2.8.0.
* Converted to build with [SBT][] 0.10.1
* Updated dependencies for [Grizzled Scala][] and [Grizzled SLF4J][].
