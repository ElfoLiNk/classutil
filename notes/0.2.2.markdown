* Added `ClassUtil` utility module, with some useful utility methods,
  including: `isPrimitive()` methods that test objects and classes to see
  if they represent primitives; an `isOfType` method that uses a Scala
  `Manifest` to allow runtime tests against generic types; and a
  `loadClass` method that simplifies loading a class from its bytes.
* Added `ScalaObjectToBean`, which takes a Scala object and creates a Java
  bean that wraps it, at runtime.
* Added `ClassNameGenerator`, which generates class names automatically.
* Refactored various internal implementation details, for ease of re-use.
* Updated to released 1.2 version of [ScalaTest][] and converted its
  dependency in [SBT][] to a test-time, not run-time, dependency.
