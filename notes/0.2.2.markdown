* Added `ClassUtil` utility module, with `isPrimitive()` methods that test
  objects and classes to see if they represent primitives.
* Added `ScalaObjectToBean`, which takes a Scala object and creates a Java
  bean that wraps it.
* Added `ClassNameGenerator`, which generates classes automatically.
* Refactored various internal implementation details, for ease of re-use.
* Updated to released 1.2 version of [ScalaTest][] and converted its
  dependency in [SBT][] to a test-time, not run-time, dependency.
