The `org.clapper.classutil` library (ClassUtil) is a Scala library that
locates and filters classes quickly, using the small and fast ASM
bytecode library. ClassUtil returns metadata about the classes in a lazy
iterator, for efficiency and fast startup. The package's home page is at
<http://bmc.github.com/classutil>; please see that page for complete
details.
