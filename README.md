========================================================

## NOTICE

---

**This software is still under development. Links in this document may point
to web pages that are not yet written. The library, itself, still lacks a
few features. Documentation is sparse. Goblins run freely within, unhindered
by checkpoints or armies. Check this out at your own risk.**

**This notice will be removed when the software is finished and the beasties
are vanquished.**

## Introduction

The *org.clapper.classutil* library is a Scala package that wraps a
portion of the [ASM][] bytecode library and provides methods for locating
and filtering classes quickly, returning the information about the classes
in a lazy iterator. The package's home page is at
<http://bmc.github.com/classutil>; please see that page for complete
details.
