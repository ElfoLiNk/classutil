classutil: Fast class finder utilities, plus some extras
========================================================

## Introduction

The *org.clapper.classutil* library is a Scala library that locates and
filters classes quickly, using the small and fast [ASM][] bytecode library.
ClassUtil returns metadata about the classes in a lazy iterator, for
efficiency and fast startup. Please see the [library's home page][]
for complete details.
