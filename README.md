classutil: Fast class finder utilities, plus some extras
========================================================

## Introduction

The *org.clapper.classutil* library is a Scala library that locates and
filters classes quickly, using the small and fast [ASM][] bytecode library.
ClassUtil returns metadata about the classes in a lazy iterator, for
efficiency and fast startup. The package's home page is at
<http://bmc.github.com/classutil>; please see that page for complete
details.
